E-commerce Sales Analysis

Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing an E-commerce sales dataset (sourced from Kaggle)
using Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI. The objective was to uncover patterns in sales,
customer behavior, product performance, and profitability to support data-driven business decisions.

Visualize sales and profit trends over time.
Highlight best-performing products & categories.
Compare payment methods and customer preferences.
Support strategic decision-making for improving sales, marketing, and customer retention.

Key Features:
